<p>Colour blindness occurs when you are unable to see colour in a normal way. It is also known as colour deficiency. Colour blindness often happens when someone cannot distinguish between certain colours. This usually happens between greens and reds, and occasionally blues.</p>

<p>Colour blindness can happen when one or more of the colour cone cells are absent, not working, or detect a different colour than normal. Severe colour blindness occurs when all three cone cells are absent. Mild colour blindness happens when all three cone cells are present but one cone cell does not work right. It detects a different colour than normal. Approximately 300 million people in the world suffer from this incurable illness.</p>


<p>While being colour deficit poses many difficulties for those affected by it, it also proves to be a major obstacle for those affected to comfortably access. This website was made to provide guidelines and methods to web developers to make their website more accessible and easy- to- use for colour deficit people</p><br>
